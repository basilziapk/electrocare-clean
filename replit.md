# Overview

ElectroCare is a full-stack web application providing comprehensive solar energy solutions for administrators, technicians, and customers. It features role-specific dashboards, streamlines solar consultation, manages installations, and handles customer support (tickets and complaints). A public solar calculator is included for energy estimation. The project aims to become a leading platform for efficient solar solution delivery and support, with capabilities like a detailed solar installation wizard, product showcasing, and enhanced public information pages.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## CRUD Operations Message Styling
- Success messages: Use descriptive titles like "Installation Created", "Installation Updated" instead of generic "Success"
- Error messages: Use specific titles like "Creation Failed", "Update Failed" instead of generic "Error"
- Descriptions should be detailed and user-friendly, explaining what happened and next steps when applicable
- Follow this pattern for all CRUD operations across the platform for consistency
- Inline Validation: Always show field-specific error messages in red text below inputs instead of popup error messages
- Required fields must have red border highlighting and specific error text when validation fails

## Interface Design Standards (Critical Requirements)
1. Validation & Focus Management: Add validation checks with inline messages in red and always move focus to the component for easy navigation
2. Scrolling Requirements: Must add scroll bars where necessary to prevent content from being cut off or buttons from being hidden
3. Success Modal Standards: Success messages shouldn't appear as toast messages. They must always appear at the center of the page where the background overlay is locked and Continue button must be clicked to close it
4. Button Visibility: Buttons in the interfaces should always be visible and accessible - never hidden below the fold or cut off by container boundaries

## Template Preservation Strategy
- Design Checkpoints: Regular snapshots in replit.md with date stamps for easy reference
- Component Templates: Core UI patterns documented for consistent application across features
- Database Schema Backup: Current table structures and relationships preserved in documentation
- Authentication Template: Dual auth pattern established as reusable template for future projects
